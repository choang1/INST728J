        <h1>Hello! My name is Cynthia Hoang,</h1>
        <h2>but I prefer to go by Cindy. It's much more familiar.</h2>  
             
        <p>
            I have <em>quite</em> a range of hobbies, but to break things down I like to spend my free time 
        <ul>
            <li>trying out new things,</li>
            <li>improving myself creatively through design and illustration,</li>
            <li>photographing spaces,</li>
            <li>and relaxing at home with my loved ones.</li>
        </ul>
            When it comes to food, I'm <strong>certainly</strong> not one to be picky.<br>
        As a Vietnamese-American I am accustomed to quite a few odd dishes here and there and embrace them wholeheartedly.
       <h3><u><em>Some</em> of my favorite Vietnamese dishes:</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bo Bia</li>
            <li>Banh Xeo</li>
            <li>Chung Vit Lon</li>
            <li>Banh It Ram</li>
            <li>Pho</li>
        </ol>
        </p>   
        
        <p>Why should I fear how odd a dish may be if others have enjoyed it? I see food as a window to culture and am open to trying anything--which makes me the perfect food and travel buddy I'd say.
        </p>
        <p>I consider myself a sentimental creature and seek to capture emotions and shared experiences in photography, art, and design.<br>
        Expressing myself creatively has allowed me to slow down and appreciate the people in my life and the simplest joys in a moment.<br>
        I was once advised by a painting professor to live for the experiences, the memories, and not solely for the money.<br>
        He's right, <strong>life's too short to be focused on materialistic means.</strong> A life is more fulfilling when you can take the time to appreciate your day-to-day.
